Simple backup bot.
<br>
Currently supports MySQL dumps to your Discord porn server.
<br>
More to come as I'm looking for a good cloud storage to properly store backups.

## How to use
> `$` denotes it should be executed within your CLI.

1. `$ yarn dev:mkdir` if `dumps` folder doesn't exist
2. Configure `auth.js`; template obtainable via `auth.example.js`
3. `$ yarn test`
4. `$ node .` or `$ yarn pm2`

# Actually, you don't have to use this because this is some dumbshit I've written while bored
